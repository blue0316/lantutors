# Lantutors
Scholastic administrative app for educators, home-based tutors, and mentors to connect with students that can benefit from after-school or full-time tutoring.
The app's overwhelming long-term purpose and value is for registered tutors to perform administrative functions for on-campus or remote-based classes effectively and consistently.

Please visit the project at [lantutuors.vercel.app](https://lantutors.vercel.app).


Additionally, the restful backend API can be viwed at [appspot.com/api](https://fsdisraelias.df.r.appspot.com/). For a sample response, please visit the [commonstudents](https://fsdisraelias.df.r.appspot.com/api/commonstudents) endpoint.
